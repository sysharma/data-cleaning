Data Cleaning: On examining the excel spreadsheet, the first thing you notice is the superfluous header and footer information that needs to be taken out. The rows and columns of the dataset also needs to be switched in order to prepare the data for modeling. This is done by transposing the dataframe. The column names are renamed to all lowercase and spaces are replaced with underscores. The datatypes of each columns is examined and converted from object to numeric while simultaneously converting the “unavailable” data marked with „U‟ to “NaN”. The dataset is checked for nulls and a machine learning technique MissForest that uses Random Forest algorithm is used to impute null values. The Jupyter Notebook screenshot and the source code in plain text are pasted below.
